# 2D Game Engine

A simple 2D game engine written in Odin with SDL2.

It follows the [Pikuma Course](https://pikuma.com/courses/cpp-2d-game-engine-development) with some minor changes to fit better with Odin. That said, because it is being directly converted from C++ it's likely that some of the code is not idiomatic Odin.
